From the \\npoint of view of applied mathematics, the most well-known subset of AI is Machine Learning, \\nnamely algorithms that allow computers to learn from data, examples, and experience, rather \\nthan following pre-programmed rules ( Sharma et\\xa0al., 2019 ). However, AI is a multidisciplinary \\nfield (if not a set of several fields), encompassing philosophy, cognitive science, and social \\nsciences focused on AI implementation in real-life contexts ( Poola, 2017 ; Yin et\\xa0al., 2021 ).\\nThe implementation of AI in real-life environments requires a high-level understanding \\nof the contexts and agents involved, as well as of the potential users’ expectations.

       " Document(page_content='Triberti et al. 10.3389/frai.2024.1329605\\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 02 frontiersin.orgThe use of AI in different contexts, such as education, has \\ngenerated many concerns within the population. Studies show that \\nalthough explicit attitudes are generally positive toward the use of AI, \\nthere is still resistance at an implicit level ( Sebri et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Fietta \\net\\xa0al., 2021 ; Fortuna and Gorbaniuk, 2022 ; Triberti et\\xa0al., 2023 ). In \\ngeneral, people working in the numerous fields that involve (or could \\ninvolve) AI technologies show both an explicit and implicit positive \\nattitude toward AI ( Fietta et\\xa0al., 2021 ; Schepman and Rodway, 2023 ). \\nRegarding attitudes toward common-use tools such as ChatGPT, \\nstudies have shown that it is influenced not only by individual \\ncharacteristics such as gender but also by previous experiences of use \\n(Yilmaz et\\xa0 al., 2023 ). It is therefore necessary to provide clear \\nknowledge regarding the capabilities of AI and to train responsible \\ncitizens and students in the appropriate use of technology. AI should \\nbe\\xa0 able to improve the educational process, combining human \\ncapabilities with technological resources.\\nOn these bases, in the present paper we\\xa0performed a purpose-\\noriented literature search of contributions to provide the reader with \\nrelevant information about the implementation of AI tools in higher \\neducation, with specific focuses on conversational pedagogical agents \\nand the context of distance learning. While this is not intended to be\\xa0a \\ncomprehensive representation of the field, it sets the foundation for \\npresenting our viewpoint based on the implementation of similar tools \\nin our university’s educational programs.\\n2 AI and the educational context: a \\nfocus on conversational pedagogical \\nagents\\nThe fast development of computer science witnessed over the past \\ndecades, led to a remarkable evolution of the computational paradigms \\ndesigned to process a particularly large amount of information in \\nvarious fields of application. In this sense, the educational context is \\nnot unfamiliar to this development, as shown by the advancements in \\nthe field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), which deals \\nwith studying the applications of AI in instruction, according to \\ndifferent perspectives and pedagogical paradigms ( Tang et\\xa0al., 2021 ; \\nZhang and Aslan, 2021 ).\\nTo analyze the directions of this field of study, we\\xa0need to clarify \\nthe role played by AI in the educational context through three main \\nmodalities characterized by different AI-learner relationships. The \\nfirst modality sees the AI as an educational agent that directs  the \\nlearning processes of the student. The second approach gives AI a \\nsupporting  role in learning processes but in this case, the human-\\nmachine interaction emerges as an equal relationship aimed at solving \\nan educational task. Finally, a third paradigm configures AI as an \\nextension  of the student’s intellectual abilities assigning the leading \\nrole to the student ( Ouyang and Jiao, 2021 ).\\nA review conducted by Zhang and Aslan (2021)  identified the \\nmain application modalities of AI in education in the form of Chatbots \\n(conversational pedagogical agents) ( Fryer et\\xa0 al., 2017 ), Expert \\nSystems ( Dias et\\xa0al., 2015 ; Hwang et\\xa0al., 2020a ,b), Intelligent Tutoring \\nSystems ( Matsuda et\\xa0al., 2020 ), Machine Learning ( Wei et\\xa0al., 2018 ; \\nArpaci, 2019 ), Personalized Learning Systems ( Walkington and \\nBernacki, 2019 ), Visualizations ( Keshav et\\xa0al., 2017 ).\\nConversational agents are a great example of the ways AI could \\ncontribute to education. Indeed, AI tools such as conversational pedagogical agents have the same characteristics of interactive \\nlearning environments such as appropriability, evocativeness and \\nintegration ( Harel and Papert, 1990 ; Rospigliosi, 2023 ). Conversational \\nagents are characterized by appropriability because users, interacting \\nwith applications such as ChatGPT, can obtain personalized answers \\nto the questions they ask. Evocation, on the other hand, regards the \\nability of these tools to stimulate personal reflection by supporting the \\nexchange of conversational questions and answers. Finally, this \\nconversational approach allows for greater integration with existing \\nknowledge and promotes a deeper understanding of multiple \\nmeanings and concepts. Conversational pedagogical agents can \\nbe\\xa0used as auxiliary tools in training processes such as knowledge \\nmanagement, needs analysis, training organization and feedback on \\nresults. It has been shown that conversational pedagogical agents \\neffectively support scaffolding (i.e., the incremental mastery of a \\nconcept) by meaningful interaction ( Forsyth et\\xa0al., 2020 ). Indeed, \\nthese tools support personalized training that can improve the quality \\nof learning ( Chen F., 2022 ; Chen Z., 2022 ).\\nThe common purpose of the various branches belonging to this \\nresearch field consists in the structuring of high-quality learning \\nenvironments that can adapt promptly to the needs of the student, \\nresulting in high-level educational outcomes ( Tahiru, 2021 ). \\nConsidering the integration with other AI resources employed in \\neducation, a review by Zawacki-Richter et\\xa0al. (2019)  highlighted the \\nmain applications aimed at developing predictive models of student \\nperformance, streamlining evaluation processes, and personalization \\nof educational paths. These objectives are met by applying \\ncomputational techniques to automate tasks such as homework \\nassignments, administrative tasks, student admission processes \\n(Johnson, 2019 ) and information re-processing ( Florea and Radu, \\n2019 ). More, these strategies can facilitate e-learning through the \\nimplementation of human-machine interactions and between users \\nwithin the same educational platform ( Zhang and Aslan, 2021 ); such \\ninteraction can reach particularly complex levels through integration \\nwith digital interfaces for the creation of Embodied Conversational \\nAgents (ECA) that show human-like characteristics based on \\nparameters such as non-verbal communication ( Kay, 2012 ; \\nTahiru, 2021 ).\\nNowadays, however, there are several important open \\nquestions related to AIED. An important part of the literature \\nfocuses on the digital infrastructure without considering the \\npedagogical strategies to facilitate the inclusion of these \\ntechnologies in the educational environment ( Chen L. et\\xa0al., 2020 ; \\nChen X. et\\xa0 al., 2020 ). Moreover, the prototypes may present \\nfeatures that make their use difficult within real-world contexts \\n(for example, the time and the skills that should be\\xa0developed to \\nuse the prototypes do not fit well among the constraints of a \\nuniversity course) ( Kabudi et\\xa0al., 2021 ). It is particularly important \\nto establish a fruitful collaboration between programmers and \\neducators to apply AI in various educational contexts, without \\ncreating discomfort and disorientation in learners, in such a way \\nthat students and teachers could be\\xa0trained in the informed use of \\nsimilar technologies ( Zhang and Aslan, 2021 ).\\nOne of the strengths of AI lies in its versatility, as it can be\\xa0easily \\nintegrated with various tools and technologies. This adaptability \\nmakes AI a potential game-changer in education, particularly in the \\nrealm of e-learning. The primary objective of AI in instruction is to \\nprovide support that is more effective to students through personalized ', metadata={'source': 'data.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Triberti et al. 10.3389/frai.2024.1329605\\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 03 frontiersin.orglearning paths tailored to their specific needs, whether in online or \\nin-person settings.\\n3 Examples and important concepts \\nfor conversational pedagogical agents\\nOne of the most significant functions of AI in the field of \\neducation is to recreate personalized, interactive and experiential \\nlearning environments ( Peredo et\\xa0al., 2011 ; Chassignol et\\xa0al., 2018 ; \\nHwang and Tu, 2021 ) capable of engaging students by improving their \\nlearning skills ( Mikropoulos and Natsis, 2011 ). For example, Hwang \\net\\xa0al. (2020a)  tested an expert system that adapted learning materials \\naccording to students’ affective state (i.e., anxiety toward math), and \\ndemonstrated that both problematic affective states and cognitive load \\nwere lower in the experimental group, which also obtained better \\nlearning outcomes. Indeed, it is important to consider the effects of AI \\nuse in education concerning cognitive load and its boundaries. \\nAccording to a learning-focused conception of the construct ( Paas \\net\\xa0 al., 2016 ), cognitive load could be\\xa0 intrinsic (related to the \\nelaboration of learning materials), but also extraneous (related to \\nadditional activities within the learning process, e.g., searching for \\nmore information) or germane (related to improving the learning \\nprocess itself, e.g., schema acquisition and automation). Theoretically, \\nthe cognitive load related to interaction with a system would interfere \\nwith learning depending on how much it could be\\xa0 configured as \\nextraneous. In other words, a system designed to support learning \\nwould be\\xa0helpful insofar as it facilitates or structures the delivery of \\nlearning materials or supports schema acquisition. On the contrary, a \\ntool that requires additional effort to be\\xa0understood and used would \\ngenerate an extraneous cognitive load that hinders the learning \\nprocess and possibly reduces its perceived quality.\\nIt has been shown that chatbots, i.e., online software with \\nconversational capabilities, improved students’ learning experience \\nthanks to the personalization of content ( Rus et\\xa0al., 2013 ; Pokrivcakova, \\n2019 ). Chatbots with “humanoid” characteristics were found to \\nbe\\xa0more effective in engaging students ( Saerbeck et\\xa0al., 2010 ; Olney \\net\\xa0al., 2013 ; Johnson and Lester, 2016 ). However, it has been verified \\nthat exposure to chatbots with overly “human” features can cause a \\nfeeling of discomfort in the user that is referred to as the “Uncanny \\nValley effect” ( Hanson et\\xa0al., 2005 ; Ciechanowski et\\xa0al., 2019 ; Song and \\nShin, 2024 ). For obvious reasons, many studies on chatbots and \\nlearning focused on language learning, with inconsistent results. \\nIndeed, the review by Huang et\\xa0al. (2022)  identified some opportunities \\nand roles that a chatbot could play within language learning processes \\n(i.e., interlocutors, simulations, transmission, helpline, and \\nrecommendation) but also warned the readers about risks and \\nshortcomings. Specifically, chatbots may sound unnatural due to \\ntechnological limitations; secondarily, their positive effect on \\nmotivation may disappear over time due to the “novelty effect”; finally, \\ninteraction with chatbots could request divided attention and generate \\nextraneous cognitive load that would negatively affect the \\nlearning process.\\nConsistently, Fryer et\\xa0al. (2019)  showed that learners preferred \\nhuman to chatbot interlocutors, and interest in chatbots was predicted \\nby pre-existent attitudes toward them, for example in terms of \\nperceived utility. In a recent study ( Haryanto and Ali, 2019 ), the \\nauthors used a smartphone application called Siri, capable of helping people acquire knowledge as it can respond in a personalized way to \\nquestions. The students who participated in the study welcomed this \\napplication with motivation and enthusiasm. Instead, another research \\n(To et al., 2021 ) assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of a chatbot \\nthat gave users reminders, feedback and information to increase \\nphysical activity; while the tool obtained positive results in the \\nexperimental group compared with controls, its acceptance among \\nparticipants was just moderate and only 35% of the sample expressed \\ninterest in continuing to use the chatbot.\\nAnother category regards Web-based AI systems not based on \\nchatbots but that could be\\xa0integrated with them. These solutions track \\nand store the interactions between the student and the system to \\nacquire information about the user’s knowledge state, choice, learning \\nstyle and other relevant attributes. These systems have been found \\neffective in supporting learning and problem-solving processes as well \\nas collaborative learning and peer interactions ( Kahraman et\\xa0al., 2010 ; \\nPeredo et\\xa0al., 2011 ). These systems can build personalized teaching \\nenvironments adapted to the individual characteristics of the students \\n(Kahraman et\\xa0al., 2010 ). It has been verified that these systems can \\ncreate teaching environments that present diversified content to \\nstudents based on their previously assessed learning style (e.g., visual \\nvs. verbal; preference for abstract concepts and generalizations vs. \\nconcrete practical examples) ( Popescu, 2010 ). This approach increased \\nthe efficiency of the student’s learning process as the personalized \\nteaching environment made it possible to acquire knowledge in a \\nshort time. Matching learning materials to the student’s learning style \\ncan reduce learning effort while increasing motivation and satisfaction. \\nSuch systems are still based on AI tools and could be\\xa0 effectively \\nintegrated with highly interactive interfaces that feature conversational \\npedagogical agents that adapt their communicational style based on \\nuser data collection ( Baylor and Kim, 2005 ; Fryer et\\xa0 al., 2019 ; \\nBolarinwa et\\xa0 al., 2023 ); communicational style (e.g., formal or \\ninformal) could also impact students’ performance, motivation and \\nperceived difficulty of tasks ( Li and Graesser, 2017 , 2021 ).\\n4 Experiences and reflections\\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence technologies have supported \\nteaching and learning processes in different ways, especially in the \\nfield of distance education ( Dogan et\\xa0 al., 2023 ). In particular, the \\nprocesses of educational data mining (EDM), i.e., the analysis of all \\nthe educational data recorded on the individual characteristics of the \\nstudents (learning styles, needs, interests, etc.), have allowed the \\ncreation of paths and personalized learning with intelligent tutoring \\nsystems that direct the student toward educational content based on \\nhis profile and offer personalized feedback and assessments ( Wang \\net\\xa0al., 2022 ). Personalized online educational spaces support better \\nlearning outcomes ( Walkington and Bernacki, 2019 ). For example, AI \\ntools can improve the learning experience in language studies \\ncompared to “human peers” ( Fryer et\\xa0al., 2017 ).\\nPegaso Telematic University, as one of world-leaders in distance \\nlearning and the use of new technologies for education, is currently \\nevaluating AI solutions to improve its educational programs as well as \\nthe platform that is already used by students and professors to support \\nlearning. Our assessment of some opportunities available on the \\nmarket has led us to share reflections that resulted in the \\npresent contribution.', metadata={'source': 'data.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Triberti et al. 10.3389/frai.2024.1329605\\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 04 frontiersin.orgAs hinted at above, conversational pedagogical agents available for \\neducation still tend to focus on specific tasks: for example, it is possible \\nto create chatbot-based solutions that are trained in course materials \\nand can respond to students’ questions anywhere, anytime. Most of \\nthese areas regard the application of AI in reproducing teaching tasks \\nand supporting learning by acting as a lecturer. A crucial aspect of AI \\nis the ability to adapt the contents based on the learner’s characteristics \\nand needs that could emerge during the learning process. According \\nto this view, the teacher, who would be\\xa0able to exercise empathy, could \\nperform the adaptation. Nevertheless, the AI tools have a great asset: \\nthe ability to reduce the time delay in the reply. This is even more \\nrelevant because the importance of e-learning increased because of the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic ( Lemay et\\xa0al., 2021 ; Kim et\\xa0al., 2022 ).\\nIt is possible to identify five strength points in a system able to \\nprovide intelligent, personalized support promptly. The actions that \\nmake the conversational pedagogical agent a desirable educational \\nresource are:\\n1. Providing immediate feedback, e.g., timely corrections to the \\nstudent’s answers;\\n2. Aligning the replies with the lesson progression; in other words, \\na chatbot could respond to questions considering the course material \\nthat the student is accessing in the here-and-now or is about to in the \\nnext sections;\\n3. Maintaining the student in the flow experience in a personalized \\nmanner; indeed, not being able to receive a response while studying \\nmay lead to a “break in presence” in the usage of technology that \\nwould negatively affect recall and the learning experience as a whole \\n(Ahn et\\xa0al., 2022 );\\n4. Preventing the rise of doubts or misunderstandings on \\nfundamental concepts while the study process is being carried on;\\n5. Providing information about prerequisites needed for a specific \\nlesson or course material that the student is about to access, possibly \\nbased on information about the individual student’s progress;\\n6. Stimulate critical thinking through the promotion of \\nconversational-based learning, which is a learning mode that emerges \\nfrom an exchange of questions and answers between chatbot and \\nstudent ( Rospigliosi, 2023 ).\\nTherefore, while the timeliness of “basic” chatbots (i.e., \\nconversational pedagogical agents trained to only answer questions \\nabout course materials) could be\\xa0an asset, it is possible to extend their \\ncapabilities and identify lines of improvement. The primary challenge \\nassociated with the use of chatbots pertains to achieving genuine \\npersonalization in learning and seamless integration into various \\nvirtual learning environments. In distance education communication \\nbarriers, lack of interactions, and difficulty in obtaining immediate \\nfeedback from teachers are significant drawbacks ( Zaheer and Munir, \\n2020 ; Kusmaryono et\\xa0al., 2021 ). The interactivity of chatbots plays a \\ncrucial role in distance learning, with increasing utilization observed \\nin addressing engagement in higher education institutions ( Studente \\nand Ellis, 2020 ; Wollny et\\xa0al., 2021 ), thereby fostering a motivating \\nenvironment even in online and distance learning contexts \\n(Chumkaew, 2023 ). Chatbots in distance learning cover two primary \\nfunctions: providing support and delivering feedback ( Vázquez-Cano \\net\\xa0al., 2021 ). Consequently, we\\xa0have identified four specific use case \\nscenarios on the basis of these main functions (see Table\\xa01 ) in which \\nconversational pedagogical agents can support the work and role of \\nprofessors/educators, with particular attention to distance education \\naccording to a human-in-the-loop approach.The implementation of the scenarios proposed in Table\\xa01  involves \\na preliminary collection of data on the profile of students who use \\nchatbots in the field of e-learning ( Wu et\\xa0al., 2020 ). In particular, the \\npossibility to realize these scenarios requires a profiling of students \\nbased on different types of information. These can be\\xa0collected, for \\nexample, in the form of demographic data, school achievement data \\nand psychological data (e.g., questionnaires; behavioral measures such \\nas frequency and duration of access to services) in order to define \\nneeds and specific learning styles so that personalized content could \\nbe\\xa0designed ( Vladova et\\xa0al., 2019 ; Kaiss et\\xa0al., 2023 ).\\nIt should be\\xa0emphasized that conversational pedagogical agents \\nshould not replace teachers and professors in any aspect of the \\nlearning processes but rather interact with them in a collaborative \\nprocess as the capabilities of humans and AI can be\\xa0complementary \\n(Chen F., 2022 ; Chen Z., 2022 ). While humans outperform AI in \\ndealing with new and unstructured problems where emotional and \\nvalue communication as well as adaptation to the environment are \\nnecessary, AI outperforms humans in addressing repetitive, objective \\nproblems, structured ones that require data management. In this \\nsense, the cooperation between teachers and artificial educational \\nagents, represents the future of education. In this framework, it is \\nessential to also consider the ethical implications. When conversational \\nchatbots handle sensitive data, such as managing students’ academic \\nrecords, adhering to regulations like the EU’s General Data Protection \\nRegulation (GDPR) becomes crucial for guiding automated decision-\\nmaking processes that may arise. Additionally, clear communication \\nto the users regarding the disclosure of conversations with chatbots is \\ncrucial ( Okonkwo and Ade-Ibijola, 2021 ). Furthermore, in all \\nscenarios proposed where conversational agents serve in the \\npersonalization of the learning experience is pivotal the \\ncommunication to the users about the nature of the interaction as \\nnon-human to prevent misinterpretations ( Adamopoulou and \\nMoussiades, 2020 ). As hinted at above, also in education it is necessary \\nto implement a “human-in-the-loop” approach ( Mosqueira-Rey et\\xa0al., \\n2023 ), namely prefiguring and defining the role of humans within a \\nprocess that is just partially automatized. In particular, the teacher can \\nsupport and coordinate AI in tackling open teaching problems and, \\nsupported by technology in some tasks, use creative energies to \\nimprove students’ learning motivation as well as the quality of the \\nrelationship with them ( Tong et\\xa0al., 2019 ). Furthermore, according to \\na vision of Usable artificial intelligence ( Xu, 2019 ) the results of AI \\nmust be\\xa0accessible to users for real collaborative learning between man \\nand machine to take place.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 “Better than my professor”?\\nTo position themselves as a truly groundbreaking technology in \\nhigher education, conversational pedagogical agents should be\\xa0able to \\ndo something more than a human professor. As we\\xa0will see later in the \\npresent contribution, this does not mean in any way that we\\xa0expect \\nthat any AI tool could fully take on the role of teachers and educators \\nand replace them. Y et, AI tools and especially conversational \\npedagogical agents would be\\xa0able to do something more than just \\nrespond earlier than a human to students’ questions.

While these ideas still relate to \\nTable\\xa01  scenarios in terms of general aims (i.e., supporting course \\nfruition and improving personalization of learning), they make some \\nsteps further toward contents and features of the learning process that \\ngo beyond the mere course materials. For example, AI (and especially \\nconversational pedagogical agents supported by sophisticated data \\nanalysis) implemented in high-level education could perform the \\nsubsequent tasks:\\n - Collecting user data from the interaction with the students and \\nclassifying their necessities; e.g., finding specific information \\nwithin course material vs. simulating examination vs. suggesting \\nlinks, additional materials for in-depth analysis beyond \\ncourse materials;\\n - Providing personalized suggestions about studying methods  and \\nabout how to approach the whole study program;\\n - Identifying and highlighting connections between study \\nmaterials from different courses; designing conceptual maps, or \\nanalyzing, correcting and improving students’ notes;\\n - Facilitating the communication between the student and the \\nprofessor by providing automated responses to simple questions \\n(e.g., reminding deadlines and formal procedures) while forwarding \\nto the professor the questions related to scientific content only;\\n - Drawing from behavioral change and motivation theories to \\nprovide adapted motivational feedback (suggestions, \\nencouragement, even hedonic comments and humor) to keep \\nstudents’ engagement at a high level; this could be\\xa0tailored to \\nstudents’ personality as well as communicational style and \\nexplicit needs. Indeed, personalized and specific motivational feedback (instead of generalized nudges or encouragement) is \\nproven to improve learning outcomes, Perikos et\\xa0al., 2017 ).\\nSuch a chatbot would actually exceed the mere “teaching, ” crossing \\nover to authentic educational effort. Of course, when we\\xa0prefigure \\nsuch a technology, it is more and more important to recover the role \\nof human educators. AI modules can help the teacher ensure a \\npersonalized approach and ongoing support that may not be\\xa0feasible \\nfor a human teacher. Previous studies have demonstrated the positive \\nimpact of chatbot applications on learning outcomes, although these \\neffects may vary depending on instructional levels and the duration of \\nintervention in the learning application ( Wu and Yu, 2023 ). However, \\nthe presence of human lecturers remains unquestionably important. \\nHuman professors play a crucial role in addressing complex questions \\nthat extend beyond the scope of a single course, requiring \\nmultidisciplinary and multifaceted knowledge. Only a human lecturer \\ncan guide students when critical judgment or ethical considerations \\nare needed. The strength of AI chatbot applications lies in easing the \\nburden on lecturers, allowing them to avoid being overwhelmed by a \\nflood of emails with short, delayed responses. Instead, AI chatbots can \\nenhance interactions with students through dedicated synchronous, \\neven online, lessons that encourage meaningful engagement after \\nstudents have had time for in-depth reflection.\\n6 Conclusion\\nThe present contribution resumed the opportunities represented \\nby AI, especially in the field of distance higher education, focusing \\nmainly on AI-based tools that could interact with learners directly to \\nsupport technology-mediated learning processes (conversational \\npedagogical agents and chatbots). Based on the literature and our \\nreflections while evaluating resources for possible integration into our \\ninstitution’s educational programs, we\\xa0 have identified the positive \\naspects of chatbots being able to respond in a timely manner, but also \\nmaintained that an AI system for learning should be\\xa0 able to do \\n“something more” than what a human professor could do just with less TABLE\\xa01  (Continued)\\nUse case \\nscenariosChallenge What AI \\nsystems would/\\ncould doHuman-in-the-\\nloopOutcomes/\\nMesurable \\nindicatorsExamples from the \\nliterature\\nOnline classes \\nwith \\npersonalized \\neducational \\ncontents; \\nstudent-\\ncentered \\nlearning aids \\nand toolsNot all students have the \\nsame characteristics in terms \\nof learning styles, needs, \\ninterests, etc. Therefore, not \\nall educational content is \\nsuitable for all learners. \\nDistance education is also \\nsupposed to meet specific \\nneeds such as work-study \\nintegrationAI tools could analyze \\nstudents’ characteristics \\nin order to sort them \\ninto specific online \\nclasses with educational \\ncontent suited to their \\nneeds, and/or point \\nthem toward specific \\nlearning aids tailored \\non particular situations \\nwith specific and \\npersonalized feedbackThe professor could \\nfocus on creating \\ndifferent teaching \\nmaterials for each course \\ncontent suitable for \\nspecific types of users, \\nand develop learning \\naids that respond to \\nstudents’ necessitiesStudents’ evaluation of \\ncourse contents after \\npersonalization \\n(compared with \\nprevious non-\\npersonalized learning)Kaiss et\\xa0al., (2023) —description of a \\nprototype integrated in Moodle \\nplatform providing personalized \\nlearning objects in distance learning\\nWu et\\xa0al.

      "According to a learning-focused conception of the construct ( Paas \n",

      "elaboration of learning materials), but also extraneous (related to \n",

      "more information) or germane (related to improving the learning \n",
      "process itself, e.g., schema acquisition and automation). Theoretically, \n",
      "the cognitive load related to interaction with a system would interfere \n",
      "with learning depending on how much it could be  configured as \n",
      "extraneous. In other words, a system designed to support learning \n",
      "would be helpful insofar as it facilitates or structures the delivery of \n",
      "learning materials or supports schema acquisition. On the contrary, a \n",
      "tool that requires additional effort to be understood and used would \n",
      "generate an extraneous cognitive load that hinders the learning \n",

      "conversational capabilities, improved students’ learning experience \n",
      "thanks to the personalization of content ( Rus et al., 2013 ; Pokrivcakova, \n",
      "2019 ). Chatbots with “humanoid” characteristics were found to \n",
      "be more effective in engaging students ( Saerbeck et al., 2010 ; Olney \n",
      "et al., 2013 ; Johnson and Lester, 2016 ). However, it has been verified \n",
      "that exposure to chatbots with overly “human” features can cause a \n",
      "feeling of discomfort in the user that is referred to as the “Uncanny \n",
      "Valley effect” ( Hanson et al., 2005 ; Ciechanowski et al., 2019 ; Song and \n",
      "Shin, 2024 ). For obvious reasons, many studies on chatbots and \n",
      "learning focused on language learning, with inconsistent results. \n",
      "Indeed, the review by Huang et al. (2022)  identified some opportunities \n",
      "and roles that a chatbot could play within language learning processes \n",
      "(i.e., interlocutors, simulations, transmission, helpline, and \n",
      "recommendation) but also warned the readers about risks and \n",
      "shortcomings. Specifically, chatbots may sound unnatural due to \n",

      "interaction with chatbots could request divided attention and generate \n",
      "extraneous cognitive load that would negatively affect the \n",
      "learning process.\n",
      "Consistently, Fryer et al. (2019)  showed that learners preferred \n",
      "human to chatbot interlocutors, and interest in chatbots was predicted \n",
      "by pre-existent attitudes toward them, for example in terms of \n",
      "perceived utility. In a recent study ( Haryanto and Ali, 2019 ), the \n",
      "authors used a smartphone application called Siri, capable of helping people acquire knowledge as it can respond in a personalized way to \n",
      "questions. The students who participated in the study welcomed this \n",
      "application with motivation and enthusiasm. Instead, another research \n",
      "(To et al., 2021 ) assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of a chatbot \n",
      "that gave users reminders, feedback and information to increase \n",
      "physical activity; while the tool obtained positive results in the \n",
      "experimental group compared with controls, its acceptance among \n",

      "(Kahraman et al., 2010 ). It has been verified that these systems can \n",
      "create teaching environments that present diversified content to \n",
      "students based on their previously assessed learning style (e.g., visual \n",
      "vs. verbal; preference for abstract concepts and generalizations vs. \n",

(2024), se ha observado que las herramientas de inteligencia artificial, como los agentes pedagógicos conversacionales, han mejorado el proceso educativo al combinar las capacidades humanas con los recursos tecnológicos. Estos agentes pueden actuar como auxiliares en procesos de formación, gestión del conocimiento, análisis de necesidades, organización de la formación y retroalimentación de resultados.\\n\\nPor ejemplo, los agentes pedagógicos conversacionales tienen la capacidad de proporcionar respuestas personalizadas a las preguntas de los usuarios, estimular la reflexión personal, promover una mayor integración con el conocimiento existente y mejorar la calidad del aprendizaje a través de la interacción significativa. Además, se ha demostrado que estos agentes apoyan el proceso de andamiaje, es decir, el dominio incremental de un concepto, a través de una interacción significativa.\\n\\nEn la educación superior, se han identificado diversas aplicaciones de la inteligencia artificial, como los Chatbots, Sistemas Expertos, Sistemas de Tutoría Inteligente, Aprendizaje Automático, Sistemas de Aprendizaje Personalizado y Visualizaciones. Estas herramientas pueden adaptarse rápidamente a las necesidades de los estudiantes, mejorar la predicción del rendimiento estudiantil, agilizar los procesos de evaluación y personalizar los caminos educativos.\\n\\nEn resumen, las inteligencias artificiales han contribuido a la creación de entornos de aprendizaje de alta calidad que se adaptan a las necesidades individuales de los estudiantes, lo que resulta en mejores resultados educativos. ¿Te gustaría explorar más sobre cómo estas herramientas podrían aplicarse en tu aula para mejorar la experiencia de aprendizaje de tus estudiantes?',\n",

       "   'Triberti et al. 10.3389/frai.2024.1329605\\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 02 frontiersin.orgThe use of AI in different contexts, such as education, has \\ngenerated many concerns within the population. Studies show that \\nalthough explicit attitudes are generally positive toward the use of AI, \\nthere is still resistance at an implicit level ( Sebri et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Fietta \\net\\xa0al., 2021 ; Fortuna and Gorbaniuk, 2022 ; Triberti et\\xa0al., 2023 ). In \\ngeneral, people working in the numerous fields that involve (or could \\ninvolve) AI technologies show both an explicit and implicit positive \\nattitude toward AI ( Fietta et\\xa0al., 2021 ; Schepman and Rodway, 2023 ). \\nRegarding attitudes toward common-use tools such as ChatGPT, \\nstudies have shown that it is influenced not only by individual \\ncharacteristics such as gender but also by previous experiences of use \\n(Yilmaz et\\xa0 al., 2023 ). It is therefore necessary to provide clear \\nknowledge regarding the capabilities of AI and to train responsible \\ncitizens and students in the appropriate use of technology. AI should \\nbe\\xa0 able to improve the educational process, combining human \\ncapabilities with technological resources.\\nOn these bases, in the present paper we\\xa0performed a purpose-\\noriented literature search of contributions to provide the reader with \\nrelevant information about the implementation of AI tools in higher \\neducation, with specific focuses on conversational pedagogical agents \\nand the context of distance learning. While this is not intended to be\\xa0a \\ncomprehensive representation of the field, it sets the foundation for \\npresenting our viewpoint based on the implementation of similar tools \\nin our university’s educational programs.\\n2 AI and the educational context: a \\nfocus on conversational pedagogical \\nagents\\nThe fast development of computer science witnessed over the past \\ndecades, led to a remarkable evolution of the computational paradigms \\ndesigned to process a particularly large amount of information in \\nvarious fields of application. In this sense, the educational context is \\nnot unfamiliar to this development, as shown by the advancements in \\nthe field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), which deals \\nwith studying the applications of AI in instruction, according to \\ndifferent perspectives and pedagogical paradigms ( Tang et\\xa0al., 2021 ; \\nZhang and Aslan, 2021 ).\\nTo analyze the directions of this field of study, we\\xa0need to clarify \\nthe role played by AI in the educational context through three main \\nmodalities characterized by different AI-learner relationships. The \\nfirst modality sees the AI as an educational agent that directs  the \\nlearning processes of the student. The second approach gives AI a \\nsupporting  role in learning processes but in this case, the human-\\nmachine interaction emerges as an equal relationship aimed at solving \\nan educational task. Finally, a third paradigm configures AI as an \\nextension  of the student’s intellectual abilities assigning the leading \\nrole to the student ( Ouyang and Jiao, 2021 ).\\nA review conducted by Zhang and Aslan (2021)  identified the \\nmain application modalities of AI in education in the form of Chatbots \\n(conversational pedagogical agents) ( Fryer et\\xa0 al., 2017 ), Expert \\nSystems ( Dias et\\xa0al., 2015 ; Hwang et\\xa0al., 2020a ,b), Intelligent Tutoring \\nSystems ( Matsuda et\\xa0al., 2020 ), Machine Learning ( Wei et\\xa0al., 2018 ; \\nArpaci, 2019 ), Personalized Learning Systems ( Walkington and \\nBernacki, 2019 ), Visualizations ( Keshav et\\xa0al., 2017 ).\\nConversational agents are a great example of the ways AI could \\ncontribute to education. Indeed, AI tools such as conversational pedagogical agents have the same characteristics of interactive \\nlearning environments such as appropriability, evocativeness and \\nintegration ( Harel and Papert, 1990 ; Rospigliosi, 2023 ). Conversational \\nagents are characterized by appropriability because users, interacting \\nwith applications such as ChatGPT, can obtain personalized answers \\nto the questions they ask. Evocation, on the other hand, regards the \\nability of these tools to stimulate personal reflection by supporting the \\nexchange of conversational questions and answers. Finally, this \\nconversational approach allows for greater integration with existing \\nknowledge and promotes a deeper understanding of multiple \\nmeanings and concepts. Conversational pedagogical agents can \\nbe\\xa0used as auxiliary tools in training processes such as knowledge \\nmanagement, needs analysis, training organization and feedback on \\nresults. It has been shown that conversational pedagogical agents \\neffectively support scaffolding (i.e., the incremental mastery of a \\nconcept) by meaningful interaction ( Forsyth et\\xa0al., 2020 ). Indeed, \\nthese tools support personalized training that can improve the quality \\nof learning ( Chen F., 2022 ; Chen Z., 2022 ).\\nThe common purpose of the various branches belonging to this \\nresearch field consists in the structuring of high-quality learning \\nenvironments that can adapt promptly to the needs of the student, \\nresulting in high-level educational outcomes ( Tahiru, 2021 ). \\nConsidering the integration with other AI resources employed in \\neducation, a review by Zawacki-Richter et\\xa0al. (2019)  highlighted the \\nmain applications aimed at developing predictive models of student \\nperformance, streamlining evaluation processes, and personalization \\nof educational paths. These objectives are met by applying \\ncomputational techniques to automate tasks such as homework \\nassignments, administrative tasks, student admission processes \\n(Johnson, 2019 ) and information re-processing ( Florea and Radu, \\n2019 ). More, these strategies can facilitate e-learning through the \\nimplementation of human-machine interactions and between users \\nwithin the same educational platform ( Zhang and Aslan, 2021 ); such \\ninteraction can reach particularly complex levels through integration \\nwith digital interfaces for the creation of Embodied Conversational \\nAgents (ECA) that show human-like characteristics based on \\nparameters such as non-verbal communication ( Kay, 2012 ; \\nTahiru, 2021 ).\\nNowadays, however, there are several important open \\nquestions related to AIED. An important part of the literature \\nfocuses on the digital infrastructure without considering the \\npedagogical strategies to facilitate the inclusion of these \\ntechnologies in the educational environment ( Chen L. et\\xa0al., 2020 ; \\nChen X. et\\xa0 al., 2020 ). Moreover, the prototypes may present \\nfeatures that make their use difficult within real-world contexts \\n(for example, the time and the skills that should be\\xa0developed to \\nuse the prototypes do not fit well among the constraints of a \\nuniversity course) ( Kabudi et\\xa0al., 2021 ). It is particularly important \\nto establish a fruitful collaboration between programmers and \\neducators to apply AI in various educational contexts, without \\ncreating discomfort and disorientation in learners, in such a way \\nthat students and teachers could be\\xa0trained in the informed use of \\nsimilar technologies ( Zhang and Aslan, 2021 ).\\nOne of the strengths of AI lies in its versatility, as it can be\\xa0easily \\nintegrated with various tools and technologies. This adaptability \\nmakes AI a potential game-changer in education, particularly in the \\nrealm of e-learning. The primary objective of AI in instruction is to \\nprovide support that is more effective to students through personalized\\n\\nTriberti et al. 10.3389/frai.2024.1329605\\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 03 frontiersin.orglearning paths tailored to their specific needs, whether in online or \\nin-person settings.\\n3 Examples and important concepts \\nfor conversational pedagogical agents\\nOne of the most significant functions of AI in the field of \\neducation is to recreate personalized, interactive and experiential \\nlearning environments ( Peredo et\\xa0al., 2011 ; Chassignol et\\xa0al., 2018 ; \\nHwang and Tu, 2021 ) capable of engaging students by improving their \\nlearning skills ( Mikropoulos and Natsis, 2011 ). For example, Hwang \\net\\xa0al. (2020a)  tested an expert system that adapted learning materials \\naccording to students’ affective state (i.e., anxiety toward math), and \\ndemonstrated that both problematic affective states and cognitive load \\nwere lower in the experimental group, which also obtained better \\nlearning outcomes. Indeed, it is important to consider the effects of AI \\nuse in education concerning cognitive load and its boundaries. \\nAccording to a learning-focused conception of the construct ( Paas \\net\\xa0 al., 2016 ), cognitive load could be\\xa0 intrinsic (related to the \\nelaboration of learning materials), but also extraneous (related to \\nadditional activities within the learning process, e.g., searching for \\nmore information) or germane (related to improving the learning \\nprocess itself, e.g., schema acquisition and automation). Theoretically, \\nthe cognitive load related to interaction with a system would interfere \\nwith learning depending on how much it could be\\xa0 configured as \\nextraneous. In other words, a system designed to support learning \\nwould be\\xa0helpful insofar as it facilitates or structures the delivery of \\nlearning materials or supports schema acquisition. On the contrary, a \\ntool that requires additional effort to be\\xa0understood and used would \\ngenerate an extraneous cognitive load that hinders the learning \\nprocess and possibly reduces its perceived quality.\\nIt has been shown that chatbots, i.e., online software with \\nconversational capabilities, improved students’ learning experience \\nthanks to the personalization of content ( Rus et\\xa0al., 2013 ; Pokrivcakova, \\n2019 ). Chatbots with “humanoid” characteristics were found to \\nbe\\xa0more effective in engaging students ( Saerbeck et\\xa0al., 2010 ; Olney \\net\\xa0al., 2013 ; Johnson and Lester, 2016 ). However, it has been verified \\nthat exposure to chatbots with overly “human” features can cause a \\nfeeling of discomfort in the user that is referred to as the “Uncanny \\nValley effect” ( Hanson et\\xa0al., 2005 ; Ciechanowski et\\xa0al., 2019 ; Song and \\nShin, 2024 ). For obvious reasons, many studies on chatbots and \\nlearning focused on language learning, with inconsistent results. \\nIndeed, the review by Huang et\\xa0al. (2022)  identified some opportunities \\nand roles that a chatbot could play within language learning processes \\n(i.e., interlocutors, simulations, transmission, helpline, and \\nrecommendation) but also warned the readers about risks and \\nshortcomings. Specifically, chatbots may sound unnatural due to \\ntechnological limitations; secondarily, their positive effect on \\nmotivation may disappear over time due to the “novelty effect”; finally, \\ninteraction with chatbots could request divided attention and generate \\nextraneous cognitive load that would negatively affect the \\nlearning process.\\nConsistently, Fryer et\\xa0al. (2019)  showed that learners preferred \\nhuman to chatbot interlocutors, and interest in chatbots was predicted \\nby pre-existent attitudes toward them, for example in terms of \\nperceived utility. In a recent study ( Haryanto and Ali, 2019 ), the \\nauthors used a smartphone application called Siri, capable of helping people acquire knowledge as it can respond in a personalized way to \\nquestions. The students who participated in the study welcomed this \\napplication with motivation and enthusiasm. Instead, another research \\n(To et al., 2021 ) assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of a chatbot \\nthat gave users reminders, feedback and information to increase \\nphysical activity; while the tool obtained positive results in the \\nexperimental group compared with controls, its acceptance among \\nparticipants was just moderate and only 35% of the sample expressed \\ninterest in continuing to use the chatbot.\\nAnother category regards Web-based AI systems not based on \\nchatbots but that could be\\xa0integrated with them. These solutions track \\nand store the interactions between the student and the system to \\nacquire information about the user’s knowledge state, choice, learning \\nstyle and other relevant attributes. These systems have been found \\neffective in supporting learning and problem-solving processes as well \\nas collaborative learning and peer interactions ( Kahraman et\\xa0al., 2010 ; \\nPeredo et\\xa0al., 2011 ). These systems can build personalized teaching \\nenvironments adapted to the individual characteristics of the students \\n(Kahraman et\\xa0al., 2010 ). It has been verified that these systems can \\ncreate teaching environments that present diversified content to \\nstudents based on their previously assessed learning style (e.g., visual \\nvs. verbal; preference for abstract concepts and generalizations vs. \\nconcrete practical examples) ( Popescu, 2010 ). This approach increased \\nthe efficiency of the student’s learning process as the personalized \\nteaching environment made it possible to acquire knowledge in a \\nshort time. Matching learning materials to the student’s learning style \\ncan reduce learning effort while increasing motivation and satisfaction. \\nSuch systems are still based on AI tools and could be\\xa0 effectively \\nintegrated with highly interactive interfaces that feature conversational \\npedagogical agents that adapt their communicational style based on \\nuser data collection ( Baylor and Kim, 2005 ; Fryer et\\xa0 al., 2019 ; \\nBolarinwa et\\xa0 al., 2023 ); communicational style (e.g., formal or \\ninformal) could also impact students’ performance, motivation and \\nperceived difficulty of tasks ( Li and Graesser, 2017 , 2021 ).\\n4 Experiences and reflections\\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence technologies have supported \\nteaching and learning processes in different ways, especially in the \\nfield of distance education ( Dogan et\\xa0 al., 2023 ). In particular, the \\nprocesses of educational data mining (EDM), i.e., the analysis of all \\nthe educational data recorded on the individual characteristics of the \\nstudents (learning styles, needs, interests, etc.), have allowed the \\ncreation of paths and personalized learning with intelligent tutoring \\nsystems that direct the student toward educational content based on \\nhis profile and offer personalized feedback and assessments ( Wang \\net\\xa0al., 2022 ). Personalized online educational spaces support better \\nlearning outcomes ( Walkington and Bernacki, 2019 ). For example, AI \\ntools can improve the learning experience in language studies \\ncompared to “human peers” ( Fryer et\\xa0al., 2017 ).\\nPegaso Telematic University, as one of world-leaders in distance \\nlearning and the use of new technologies for education, is currently \\nevaluating AI solutions to improve its educational programs as well as \\nthe platform that is already used by students and professors to support \\nlearning. Our assessment of some opportunities available on the \\nmarket has led us to share reflections that resulted in the \\npresent contribution.\\n\\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 01 frontiersin.org\\n“Better than my professor?” How \\nto develop artificial intelligence \\ntools for higher education\\nStefano\\xa0Triberti 1*, Raffaele\\xa0Di\\xa0Fuccio 1*, Chiara\\xa0Scuotto 1,2, \\nEmanuele\\xa0Marsico 1 and Pierpaolo\\xa0Limone 1\\n1 Department of Psychology and Education, Università Telematica Pegaso, Naples, Italy, 2 Department \\nof Humanistic Studies, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) tools are currently designed and tested in many fields \\nto improve humans’ ability to make decisions. One of these fields is higher \\neducation.

However, many \\nexistent tools are able to perform tasks that human professionals (educators, \\ntutors, professors) could perform, just in a timelier manner. While discussing \\nthe possible implementation of AI-based tools in our university’s educational \\nprograms, we\\xa0 reviewed the current literature and identified a number of \\ncapabilities that future AI solutions may feature, in order to improve higher \\neducation processes, with a focus on distance higher education. Specifically, \\nwe\\xa0suggest that innovative tools could influence the methodologies by which \\nstudents approach learning; facilitate connections and information attainment \\nbeyond course materials; support the communication with the professor; and, \\ndraw from motivation theories to foster learning engagement, in a personalized \\nmanner.

From the \\npoint of view of applied mathematics, the most well-known subset of AI is Machine Learning, \\nnamely algorithms that allow computers to learn from data, examples, and experience, rather \\nthan following pre-programmed rules ( Sharma et\\xa0al., 2019 ). However, AI is a multidisciplinary \\nfield (if not a set of several fields), encompassing philosophy, cognitive science, and social \\nsciences focused on AI implementation in real-life contexts ( Poola, 2017 ; Yin et\\xa0al., 2021 ).\\nThe implementation of AI in real-life environments requires a high-level understanding \\nof the contexts and agents involved, as well as of the potential users’ expectations. Indeed, as \\nthe vast literature on technology acceptance shows, users’ intentions toward technology are \\ndetermined by users’ attitudes and preconceptions rather than by technology’s actual \\neffectiveness ( Marangunić and Granić, 2015 ).OPEN ACCESS\\nEDITED BY\\nDiego Zapata-Rivera,  \\nEducational Testing Service, United\\xa0States\\nREVIEWED BY\\nBen Daniel,  \\nUniversity of Otago, New\\xa0Zealand\\nJeff Ginger,  \\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,  \\nUnited\\xa0States\\n*CORRESPONDENCE\\nStefano Triberti   \\n stefano.triberti@unipegaso.it   \\nRaffaele Di Fuccio   \\n raffaele.difuccio@unipegaso.it\\nRECEIVED 31 October 2023\\nACCEPTED 02 April 2024\\nPUBLISHED 10 April 2024\\nCITATION\\nTriberti S, Di Fuccio R, Scuotto C, \\nMarsico E and Limone P (2024) “Better than \\nmy professor?” How to develop artificial \\nintelligence tools for higher education.\\nFront.
